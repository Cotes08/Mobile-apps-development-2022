# Mobile-apps-development-2022
In this set of projects I learned how to make mobile applications in different languages. The first project is developed in Android studio and is the most complete, it is a purchase ticket manager, where you can create, delete and modify the tickets, sort them by categories or price. All data is managed by a SQLite database.  The second project are small examples of using Corodva and React Native.  The last project is another small example of using the Tabri.js tool.
